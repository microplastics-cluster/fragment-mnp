# Contribution Guide

Thanks for considering contributing to FRAGMENT-MNP. We very much welcome your input.

## Bug reports
Whilst bug reports are very welcome, we encourage pull requests to accompany these. Reports should be made via the issue tracker and should include enough information to be fully reproducible. This includes information on the system and compiler you are using, as well as detailed information about what you were doing that caused the bug.

## New and updated features
We welcome new and updated features via pull requests. Only completed features that do not require any further coding to become functional will be accepted. If you have an idea for a feature but don't have the time to code it, then consider raising a feature request issue. If you have some code towards a feature but won't have time to finish it, then raise an issue highlighting this, and if we think the feature is valuable enough, we may open a new feature branch for you to submit your code to.

Pull requests with new or updated features should, alongside the updated code, include relevant tests (in the `tests/` directory) and documentation (in the `docs/` directory).

## Which branch?
Please send pull requests for all contributions (bug reports and features) to the develop branch.

## Security vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to Sam Harrison at samharrison.xg@gmail.com. Please do not submit an issue with the vulnerability.

## Coding style
Please use PEP8 and comment your code well. We are using [NumPy/SciPy docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) in this project. Remember that code is (probably) read more often than it is written.
