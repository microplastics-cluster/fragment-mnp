# Input data

Input data must be passed to the {class}`fragmentmnp.FragmentMNP` model class. Examples are given in the {mod}`fragmentmnp.examples` module:

```python
>>> from fragmentmnp.examples import minimal_data, full_data
>>> minimal_data
{'initial_concs': [42.0, 42.0, 42.0, 42.0, 42.0, 42.0, 42.0], 'density': 1380, 'k_frag': 0.01}
>>> full_data
{'initial_concs': [42.0, 42.0, 42.0, 42.0, 42.0, 42.0, 42.0], 'density': 1380, 'k_frag': 0.01,
'theta_1': 0.0, 'k_diss': 0.0, 'k_diss_gamma': 1.0}
```

The `minimal_data` contains only required variables, whilst `full_data` includes variables that have defaults. Here we take a look at the schema for this data dict.

:::{note}
In previous versions of the model, the variables `theta_1`, `k_frag_tau` and `k_diss_gamma` were used to scale the size and time dependence of the fragmentation and dissolution rate constants `k_frag` and `k_diss`. These have been replaced with a more flexible regressions and new parameters, as detailed belowed.
:::

`initial_concs`
: *Required, list of positive floats with length equal to `n_size_classes`, units: kg/m3.*
: The intial mass concentration in each model size class. 

`initial_concs_diss`
: *Required, float, units: kg/m3.*
: The intial mass concentration in the dissolved fraction.

`density`
: *Required, float, units: kg/m3.*
: The density of the polymer being modelled.


(input-data:k)=
`k_frag`, `k_diss`
: *Required, float or dict, units: s<sup>-1</sup>.*
: Either a scalar or dictionary of regression parameters. If a scalar is provided, the fragmentation (``k_frag``) or dissolution (``k_diss``) rate will be constant in time and across particle surface areas. If a dictionary is provided, the rate will follow the time and surface area dependence according to the parameters provided. See [](./fragmentation-dissolution-rates.ipynb) for more details.

```{warning}
The 2D `k_frag` array generated by the model has been transposed compared to previous versions of the model. `k_frag` now has the shape `(n_size_classes, n_timesteps)` rather than `(n_timesteps, n_size_classes)`.
```

(input-data:fsd-beta)=
`fsd_beta`
: *Optional, float, default: 0.*
: $\beta$ is an empirical parameter that controls the dependence of the fragment size distribution `fsd` on particle diameter. The split of fragmented mass amongst daughter size classes is scaled as $\propto d^\beta$, where $d$ is the particle diameter. Thus, if $\beta = 0$ (the default), there is an even split amongst daughter size classes, if $\beta < 0$, a greater proportion of the mass goes to smaller size classes, and if $\beta > 0$, a greater proportion of the mass goes to larger size classes. See [](./advanced-usage/fragment-size-distribution.md) for more information on the fragment size distribution matrix.

```{admonition} Units
:class: tip
Strictly speaking, the FRAGMENT-MNP model is unit-agnostic. As long as the units of data specified in input data are consistent, then the units of variables output by the model will match these. For example, if you specify `initial_concs` and `density` with units of mg/m<sup>3</sup>, then output concentrations will be in mg/m<sup>3</sup>. Notably, it is worth making sure that your rate constants (`k_frag` and `k_diss`) follow the same units as your model timestep `dt`. Unless you have good reason not to (e.g. very long timesteps), we *strongly* recommend using SI units to avoid mistakes.
